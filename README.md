# Introduction
This repository is a practical example of Aarong QA activities related to Testing Planning and execution. It contains artifacts related to the following processes based in the software requirements:
Planning.
* Test Plan
* Mind Maps
* Test Report
* Test Case
* Bug Report
* Test Metrics

In this project the website Aarong was used as a object of testing. The artifacts were generated as documents and also the test plan, mind maps, bug report and execution were implemented in the open source test management tool Test Quality. These tests are intended for a human for buying cloths.At some point in the future these test willl be automated.

# Types of Testing
* UI Testing

User interface testing, a testing technique used to identify the presence of defects is a product/software under test by using Graphical user interface [GUI]
* Functional testing

Functional Testing is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.

* Usabillity Testing

Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.

# Table of Content

* Test Plan

A test plan is a comprehensive document that lists the test objectives, tactics, timeline, budget, and resources needed to complete the project. Imagine it as a guide for carrying out the tests required to make sure the program is operating properly and being regulated by testing.

* Mind Maps

Mind maps are an excellent way to keep track of changes in plans, features, and techniques in the fast-paced Agile environment. They may be used to visually identify and express test scenarios and links between components. Agile Testing Teams can utilize mindmaps as a visual thinking tool.

* Test Report

A test report summary includes all the information on the testing procedure, including what was tested, when it was tested, how it was tested, and in what environments.

* Test Case

A test case is a written document that was created for a particular test scenario to check compliance with a certain requirement. It contains a set of test data, preconditions, expected results, and postconditions.

* Bug Report

In-depth details regarding what is incorrect and what needs to be addressed in software or on a website are contained in a software bug report. For each software issue, these thorough reports include demands or details. It enables the developers to identify the issue and determine a solution.

* Test Metrics

Test metrics are measures of the efficacy, efficiency, performance, and quality of software testing methodologies. These metrics enable specialists to gather information about various testing techniques and develop strategies for improving them.
