# Introduction
This repository is a practical example of Aarong QA activities related to Testing Planning and execution. It contains artifacts related to the following processes based in the software requirements:
Planning.
* Test Plan
* Mind Maps
* Test Report
* Test Case
* Bug Report
* Test Metrics

In this project the website Aarong was used as a object of testing. The artifacts were generated as documents and also the test plan, mind maps, bug report and execution were implemented in the open source test management tool Test Quality. These tests are intended for a human for buying cloths.At some point in the future these test willl be automated.

Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.
